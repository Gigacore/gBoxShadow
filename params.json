{"name":"gBoxShadow.js","tagline":"Gravity-sensing box-shadow for Flat UI","body":"gBoxShadow.js\r\n============\r\n###### Enable gravity to your \"box-shadow\" CSS property.\r\n\r\ngBoxShadow.js induces gravity to the CSS \"box-shadow\" property and seamlessly changes the direction based on the device motion data retrived from accelerometer and gyroscope. This adds a natural experience to the UI, especially when used with Material Design.\r\n\r\nThe plugin uses ```DeviceMotionEvent``` and ```DeviceOrientationEvent``` Web APIs to detect the moment of your device. gBoxShadow.js is built on top of [gyronorm.js](https://github.com/dorukeker/gyronorm.js) to enable consistency of data across different devices.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/U1iuGjE.gif)\r\n\r\n######NOTE: \r\nThis is a concept / experimental work. The idea is to re-introduce real-world entity to UI/UX in an much more interactive and intuitive way. [Four Shadows](https://github.com/Gigacore/four-shadows) is one such attempt that I tried last year, but that was time-aware and nothing to do with physical entity. It is not recommended to use with your production app, but no harm in trying as the fallback will always ensure that nothing breaks though.\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n============\r\n\r\n######1. Include jQuery and ```gBoxShadow.js``` into your html file.\r\n\r\n######2. Add the class ```g-enabled``` to the element \r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n\t<div class=\"g-enabled btn\">I am a button</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n######3. Apply ```box-shadow``` styling of your choice to the element in your CSS:\r\n\r\n```CSS\r\n\t.btn {\r\n\t\tbox-shadow: 10px 10px 15px #A01818;\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n######4. Ensure to define the same color and blur values in your HTML using ```data-shadow-color``` and ```data-shadow-blur```:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n\t<div class=\"g-enabled btn\" data-shadow-color=\"#A01818\" data-shadow-blur=\"15\">I am a button</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFallback for unsupported devices\r\n===================\r\nThe plugin applies the effect only to the devices that support ```DeviceMotionEvent``` and ```DeviceOrientationEvent``` Web APIs. To those that doesn't, the ```box-shadow``` property you set in the CSS will be applied.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/HAPTQhT.png)\r\n\r\nDemos\r\n===================\r\nLive: http://gigacore.github.io/demos/gBoxShadow/\r\n\r\nVideo: https://youtu.be/vkKDyIstcb0\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n===================\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nMIT Â© 2015 Santhosh Sundar","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
